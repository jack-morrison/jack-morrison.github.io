                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  I am a HPC Engineer in the User Assistance and Outreach Group at the <nobr><a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility</a></nobr>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I help support the worldâ€™s <a href="https://www.top500.org/system/179397">most powerful computer</a> and its users (plus <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/">a few other supercomputers</a>, too).
                  I like to think of myself as a science enabler. I work with research teams from every scientific domain, from computational astrophysics to quantum chemistry to climate modeling,
                  in order to ensure a productive and high-performing compute environment.
